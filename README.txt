Breast cancer is the main reason of death among women worldwide. In 2012, the three most common cancers were lung cancer (1,825,000,000 death) in both sheets, breast cancer (1,677,000,000 deaths) and cancer of the colon 361,000,000. To make the diagnosis of breast cancer, samples were removed from the breast and used from image processing systems identifying the percentage of cancer through cell activity.
The aim of this project is to identify mitotic cells in histological images from the breast. In this project we develop a methodology using normalization removing Hematoxylin and eosin from the histological image, Local Binary Patterns for feature extraction and Mahalanobis distance for classification. As a sample we are using histological images stored in folders 'A03','A04','A05','A07','A10', each image has it's own annotations stored in a .csv file as a ground truth containing coordinates of the mitotic cells.
